title: My first blog post EVER!
---
"Why the f$ck do I have to write a blog when I'm being drowned by a Python in a negative linear regression fashion in the magical fluffy land of Pandas..." was the first thought that came to my mind when I was notified I had to write a blog post.

See as much as I enjoy a good blog post, I am not too fond of writing one. I am afraid at this point in time it will just sound like Peter Griffin's "You Know What Grinds My Gears Episode". You see these days, I am running on limited energy resources and thus there are a lot of things I am not too fond of doing...sorry for sounding like Slappy the Squirrel...but being pregnant in my third trimester with a squirmy little evolving Togepi and helping my two young sons adjust to elementary school while starting a Data Science Bootcamp last minute has certainly taken a toll on me. As much as I love binging on Python, going on the roller coaster ride of uncertainty of probability and statstics and basking on the nerd wonderland of linear algebra, big O mindblowns and concept of long stretch unpredictable programming sessions sometimes all I want to see is the back of my eyelids.

Seriously though...its 2 am on a Wednesday early morning and gotta be up by 6:30 am to get my kids ready for school...the struggle of lack of sleep is real...
