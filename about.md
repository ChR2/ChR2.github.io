STEM lover and enthusiast. Biomedical engineer turned tech instructor with a passion to explore, problem solve and teach. I am currently in a quest to bridge my love of tikering, my love of software and hardware interface with the likes of Arduinos, Raspberry Pi's with my love of research and knowledge from my engineering past and enter the amazing world of data science. I am fond of group projects, pair programming and giving and receiving kind and actionable feedback. I love collaborating in ideas that can potentially revolutionize tech in general and encourage the involvement of children, minorities in particular, into tech.


### More Information

Nerding out is my fulltime passion along with being a mom of two lovely little boys: Ian, Ayden and Anton. 

Apart from all nerd things, I enjoy long distance running. This year I look forward to running the 2018 Chicago Marathon and NYC Marathon. I reside in Jackson Heights, the land of cheap and great multicultural food...and thus I am a self proclaimed Latina foodie.
