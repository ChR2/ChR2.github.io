STEM lover and enthusiast. Biomedical engineer turned junior Rails developer with a passion to explore, problem solve and teach. I am currently in a quest to bridge my love of tikering, my love of software and hardware interface with the likes of Arduinos, Raspberry Pi's with my love of research and knowledge from my engineering past and enter the amazing world of data science. I am fond of group projects, pair programming and giving and receiving kind and actionable feedback. I love collaborating in ideas that can potentially revolutionize tech in general and encourage the involvement of children, girls in particular, into tech.


### More Information

Nerding out is my fulltime passion along with being a mom of two lovely little boys, Ian and Ayden. My little nerd team is gearing towards expansion this holiday season with the much awaited arrival of my third son, Anton, who is currently powering up and evolving while I go through my Data Science Bootcamp at Metis.

Apart from all nerd things, I enjoy long distance running and am happy to annouce I will be running the 2017 NYC Half Marathon and the 2017 NYC marathon thanks to my recent qualification. I reside in Jackson Heights, the land of cheap and great multicultural food...and thus I am a self proclaimed foodie.
